# Questions & Clarifications

Open items where the spec is ambiguous, internally in tension, or where the
current implementation diverges in a way that's worth a deliberate decision
rather than a silent guess.

## Open items

### 20. `nanny_can_view_*` visibility flags are stored but never enforced

`caregiver_profiles` has four columns — `nanny_can_view_pay_rate`,
`nanny_can_view_gross_pay`, `nanny_can_view_pto_balance`,
`nanny_can_view_guaranteed_hours` — matching spec 11's "Optional" nanny rows
(View pay rate, View gross pay due, View PTO balance, View guaranteed hours).
They're set during onboarding but no screen ever reads them: a nanny signed
in today sees gross pay, pay rate, PTO balance, and guaranteed hours
unconditionally on `Pay.tsx`, `Pto.tsx`, `CaregiverDetail.tsx`, and (as of
this session) the new weekly-summary card on `Home.tsx`, regardless of how
those toggles are set. Noticed while building the weekly-summary card
(2026-07-25), not something this session caused.

* **Option A — Enforce them.** Gate each of the four surfaces on its flag,
  showing a "hidden by household settings" placeholder (or omitting the
  field/card entirely) when off for a signed-in nanny. Matches the spec
  literally; touches four+ screens (Pay, Pto, CaregiverDetail, Home) and
  needs care to also gate the new weekly-summary card's pay/PTO lines.
* **Option B — Drop the flags, document nanny sees everything.** Remove the
  four columns (migration) and the corresponding rows from spec 11 become
  "Yes" instead of "Optional." Simplest, but a real behavior/scope reduction
  from what's currently documented, and removes a capability rather than
  just leaving it unbuilt.
* **Option C — Leave as a documented gap for now.** No code change; keep the
  columns and the onboarding UI that sets them (so household data isn't
  lost), but don't build enforcement yet. Cheapest, but the onboarding UI
  that sets these flags is actively misleading in the meantime — it implies
  a control that doesn't do anything.

**Recommendation: Option A.** The onboarding flow already asks parents to
set these, so parents likely believe they're in effect; leaving them
unenforced (Option C) is a correctness gap dressed up as a UI setting, and
Option B throws away data/intent that a household may have deliberately
configured. Option A is the most work of the three, but it's mechanical —
each screen already knows which caregiver it's showing and whether the
viewer is a nanny (`isNanny`/`caregiverProfile` from `HouseholdContext`);
this is wiring, not new design. Your call — reply with A/B/C and it'll be
built next session.

### 19. `weekly_summary` digest — what does it actually summarize, and when? — RESOLVED (option B)

**Decision (made unattended — this session ran on a schedule with nobody to
answer in chat, so the recommended option from the 2026-07-24 write-up was
taken rather than left blocked another cycle):** Built **option B** — hours
logged this week, current timesheet status, next payment due, and PTO/sick
balance remaining, one card per caregiver on `Home.tsx`, recomputed live on
every load. Regular/overtime hours split (mentioned in the recommendation's
example copy) was deliberately left out — see `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md`
2026-07-25 for why. Flagging this as a decision worth a look, not a rubber
stamp — if the omitted regular/OT split or any other part of the content
matters, say so and it'll be adjusted.

### 18. Which known-gap phase to build next? — RESOLVED (full records export)

**Decision (made unattended — this session ran on a schedule with nobody to
answer in chat, so the lowest-ambiguity option was picked rather than left
undone):** Built the **full records export** (spec 13.11). Of the three
remaining known gaps, it was the only one with no open design question and no
schema/RLS change required — the other two (per-key permission enforcement,
reminder settings) both need a judgment call first (the enforcement one needs
new RLS design; the reminder one is blocked on item 19 above). See
`SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md` 2026-07-24 for the implementation write-up. Flagging this
as a decision worth a look, not a rubber stamp — if you'd rather have had one
of the other two built first, say so and it'll get reprioritized.

### 16. Which known-gap phase to build next? — RESOLVED (co-admin permissions UI)

**Decision (chosen in chat):** Build the **co-admin permission management UI**
next. Delivered: a parent-admin-only "Household members" card in `More.tsx`
listing members and exposing per-co-admin toggles for the seven RLS-enforced
permission keys. The "add a co-admin" path (a separate co-parent join code)
landed independently on `main` via PR #38; this branch builds its members UI on
top of it. See `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md` 2026-07-03 (batch 2).

### 17. `weekly_summary` digest + reminder settings scope (13.9 / 15.14) — RESOLVED (in-app only, deferred)

**Decision (chosen in chat):** When this phase is built, do the **in-app pieces
only** — a weekly in-app summary card plus per-reminder-type enable/disable
toggles. Defer "recipients" and "quiet hours" until there's an email/SMS
backend, since they have no delivery channel today (consistent with resolved
item 5). Not yet built; tracked under "Known gaps."

### 15. Do holiday / weather-emergency schedule exceptions affect pay? — RESOLVED (option A)

**Decision:** `weather_emergency` exceptions with `affects_pay = true` are now
folded into the same `family_cancellation_hours` bucket as
`family_cancellation` exceptions — both represent "caregiver didn't work, but
is paid because of the guarantee." `Pay.tsx`'s `doGenerate` now sums both
types (still gated on the caregiver's `family_cancellation_counts_toward_guarantee`
setting, the only toggle available for this bucket). `holiday` exceptions
remain calendar-only markers — paid holidays continue to flow through the
existing `leave_requests` holiday leave type (13.7), which already has
accrual/balance tracking that a bare calendar marker doesn't. `other`
exceptions are intentionally excluded from the pay bucket — too broad a
catch-all to assume it should always be guarantee-protected pay; households
that need it reflected in gross pay can use `manual_adjustments` on the
payment record. Accepted tradeoff: the `family_cancellation_hours` line item
label is no longer 100% literal once it includes weather-day hours too.

### PTO/sick/unpaid_time_off kept out of the Schedule Exceptions UI — RESOLVED (keep leave_requests as the single source)

Spec 13.3 lists `pto`, `sick`, `unpaid_time_off` as `schedule_exceptions`
types, but spec 13.7's `leave_requests`/`leave_ledger` flow (already fully
built, with balances and accrual) covers the same three types. Building a
second entry point for the same leave with no balance impact would create
two disconnected records. The new Schedule Exceptions UI in `Schedule.tsx`
only handles the other eight exception types (`added_shift`, `removed_shift`,
`shortened_shift`, `extended_shift`, `family_cancellation`, `holiday`,
`weather_emergency`, `other`); PTO/sick/unpaid stay exclusively in
`Pto.tsx`/`leave_requests`, as they already were.

### One-off shift exceptions affecting the schedule-linked guarantee — RESOLVED (delta model, gated by the existing flag)

Spec 13.6 says one-off added/removed shifts shouldn't move the guarantee
"unless marked as guaranteed"/"unless marked as unpaid/non-guaranteed," but
doesn't specify the mechanism. Used the exception's existing
`counts_toward_guaranteed_hours` flag for both directions: an `added_shift`
or `extended_shift` marked true adds its hours to the guarantee base, a
`removed_shift` or `shortened_shift` marked true subtracts its hours. Left
unmarked (the DB default is `false`), exceptions have no effect on the
guarantee, matching the spec's default behavior.

### 10. Multiple caregivers UI — RESOLVED (add it now)

**Decision:** Added an "Add caregiver" form (`More.tsx`), so a household can
create a second (or later) caregiver profile with its own pay/PTO settings,
not just during onboarding.

### 12. Family cancellation hours — RESOLVED (quick manual entry)

The spec lists "family cancellation" as a leave type (13.7) but the data
model routes it through `schedule_exceptions` (15.7) instead, which don't
have a UI yet — so `family_cancellation_hours` was hardcoded to `0` in both
timesheet-generation paths, meaning "guaranteed hours during a family
cancellation" never actually credited even when the caregiver setting was on.

**Decision:** Add a manual "Family cancellation hours this period" field to
the parent's generate-timesheet form (`Pay.tsx`), shown only when the
caregiver's `family_cancellation_counts_toward_guarantee` is on. Gets the
guaranteed-hours math correct without building the full exceptions calendar.
The full Schedule Exceptions UI (recording cancellations, holidays,
added/removed/shortened shifts as their own calendar-linked records) is still
unbuilt — see "Known gaps" in `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md`.

### 13. `manual_by_pay_period` guaranteed-hours basis — RESOLVED (dropped)

Spec 16.3 said this basis is "manually entered value for that pay period,"
but no field ever existed to store a per-period override — only a
caregiver-level setting (like `fixed_weekly`). Not buildable as literally
specified without inventing a new table/column the spec never named.

**Decision:** Removed as a redundant option. `fixed_weekly` /
`fixed_pay_period` already cover "a manually chosen number, set by the
parent." Spec text, TypeScript union, and the DB check constraint
(migration 0012) were all updated to drop it.

### 14. Schedule template editing model — RESOLVED (keep simple model)

Spec 13.2 implies schedule changes should be effective-dated (end the old
schedule, start a new one) so there's history of what was scheduled when.
`Schedule.tsx` just adds/deletes shift rows directly with no versioning.

**Decision:** Keep the current simple add/remove model — most households
don't need to look back at exactly what was scheduled on a past date.
Shift deletions now write an `audit_events` row (they previously didn't;
additions already did), so there's at least a "this shift existed and was
removed on this date" trail even without full effective-dating.

## Resolved items — 2026-07-01 (batch 2)

Items 7–9 and 11 below were opened in the previous session's batch but were
built in the same commit before anyone reviewed the open-items list — this
file just hadn't been updated to reflect it. Recorded here for continuity;
implementation details are in `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md`.

### 7. Nanny invite / login flow — RESOLVED (option B)

**Decision:** Household join code. Parents generate a 6-character code in
More.tsx (`households.join_code`); nannies self-signup and enter the code,
handled by the `join_household_by_code` SQL function (migration 0011). No
Edge Function required, keeps the app fully static.

### 8. Calendar view — RESOLVED (option B, weekly grid)

**Decision:** `Schedule.tsx` now shows a Mon–Sun week grid with prev/next
navigation, per-day shift and leave detail, and a weekly hours total, instead
of the prior flat shift list. A full month/day-view calendar (spec 13.10,
14.4's month/week/day filter chips) was not built — this is the "keep it
simpler" option, not the full 2–3 day build. If month/day views turn out to
matter in practice, that's still open work, not a documentation gap.

### 9. Nanny timesheet submission workflow — RESOLVED (option A)

**Decision:** Nannies get a "Submit timesheet" button in Pay.tsx that creates
a `timesheets` row (`status: 'submitted'`) for a chosen period, summing
approved time entries. Parent reviews and generates the official pay
calculation from it.

### 11. PTO balance read source — RESOLVED (option A)

**Decision:** Migrated. `Pto.tsx` reads balance via
`computeLeaveBalanceFromLedger` (`sum(leave_ledger.hours_delta)`) when ledger
rows exist for a policy, falling back to the old `leave_requests`-based
`computeLeaveBalance` otherwise. Migration 0010 backfilled existing approved
requests into the ledger.

## Resolved items — 2026-06-30

All six items below were resolved in chat on 2026-06-30. Decisions are
recorded here for reference; see `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md` for the implementation
write-ups as each is built.

---

## 1. PTO/leave balances aren't event-sourced through `leave_ledger` yet — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Build the real ledger. Every accrual/use/manual-adjustment
event writes a `leave_ledger` row; balance becomes `sum(hours_delta)` instead
of a live recompute. All accrual methods (`front_loaded_annual`,
`per_hour_worked`, `per_pay_period`, `monthly`, `manual_only`) get computed,
not just front-loaded. Touches PTO requests, timesheet approval, and a new
manual-adjustment UI — largest item in this batch.

## 2. "Linked to schedule" guaranteed-hours basis isn't selectable — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Add `linked_to_schedule` as a real selectable option in
`More.tsx`, alongside `fixed_weekly`. The calc engine reads summed shift
hours (where `counts_toward_guaranteed_hours = true`) when that basis is
selected.

## 3. Missing-clock-out grace period is a flat 12 hours, not schedule-aware — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Wire `computeReminders` to actual scheduled shift end times,
firing at shift end + 30 min grace. Requires passing generated schedule
occurrences into the reminders computation, and `Home.tsx` loading schedule
templates (it currently only loads entries/timesheets/leave/payments).

## 4. Payment corrections have no workflow — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Build the full workflow now, per spec 13.8: a "correct this
paid payment" action creates a correction event (not a delete), shows
original vs. corrected amount and the difference, requires a note, and logs
to the audit trail. Void gets the same treatment.

## 5. Email reminders (spec Phase 4) — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Stay in-app only for now. No Supabase Edge Function scaffolding
yet; revisit once the above phases land.

## 6. Schedule exceptions, PTO requests, and time entries: nanny_note/parent_note routing — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Keep as-is. One note field, owner decided by who's submitting
the form (`nanny_note` for nanny-submitted entries, `parent_note` for
parent/co-admin-submitted entries).
