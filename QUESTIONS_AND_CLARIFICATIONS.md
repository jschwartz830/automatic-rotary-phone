# Questions & Clarifications

Open items where the spec is ambiguous, internally in tension, or where the
current implementation diverges in a way that's worth a deliberate decision
rather than a silent guess.

All six items below were resolved in chat on 2026-06-30. Decisions are
recorded here for reference; see `SPEC_CHANGE_LOG.md` for the implementation
write-ups as each is built.

---

## 1. PTO/leave balances aren't event-sourced through `leave_ledger` yet — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Build the real ledger. Every accrual/use/manual-adjustment
event writes a `leave_ledger` row; balance becomes `sum(hours_delta)` instead
of a live recompute. All accrual methods (`front_loaded_annual`,
`per_hour_worked`, `per_pay_period`, `monthly`, `manual_only`) get computed,
not just front-loaded. Touches PTO requests, timesheet approval, and a new
manual-adjustment UI — largest item in this batch.

## 2. "Linked to schedule" guaranteed-hours basis isn't selectable — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Add `linked_to_schedule` as a real selectable option in
`More.tsx`, alongside `fixed_weekly`. The calc engine reads summed shift
hours (where `counts_toward_guaranteed_hours = true`) when that basis is
selected.

## 3. Missing-clock-out grace period is a flat 12 hours, not schedule-aware — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Wire `computeReminders` to actual scheduled shift end times,
firing at shift end + 30 min grace. Requires passing generated schedule
occurrences into the reminders computation, and `Home.tsx` loading schedule
templates (it currently only loads entries/timesheets/leave/payments).

## 4. Payment corrections have no workflow — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Build the full workflow now, per spec 13.8: a "correct this
paid payment" action creates a correction event (not a delete), shows
original vs. corrected amount and the difference, requires a note, and logs
to the audit trail. Void gets the same treatment.

## 5. Email reminders (spec Phase 4) — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Stay in-app only for now. No Supabase Edge Function scaffolding
yet; revisit once the above phases land.

## 6. Schedule exceptions, PTO requests, and time entries: nanny_note/parent_note routing — RESOLVED

**Decision:** Keep as-is. One note field, owner decided by who's submitting
the form (`nanny_note` for nanny-submitted entries, `parent_note` for
parent/co-admin-submitted entries).
