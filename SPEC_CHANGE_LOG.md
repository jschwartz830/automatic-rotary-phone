# Spec Change Log

Tracks decisions made while implementing against `APPLICATION_SPEC.md`: where an
implementation detail wasn't fully specified, where two parts of the spec were
in tension, or where a deliberate simplification was made. This is a running
log, newest entries on top. See `QUESTIONS_AND_CLARIFICATIONS.md` for open
items that need your decision rather than ones already resolved.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase: nanny-facing gaps closed

**Manual time entry now pre-fills from the scheduled shift (spec 13.4, 13.2).**
`src/routes/Time.tsx` previously hardcoded the manual entry form to
09:00–17:00 regardless of date. It now looks up the caregiver's generated
schedule occurrence for the selected date (via `generateShiftsForRange`) and
pre-fills start time, end time, and break minutes from that shift, falling
back to 09:00–17:00 only when nothing is scheduled that day. The date field
still defaults to today, as before. Values remain fully editable — this only
changes the starting point, consistent with spec 13.4's manual-entry fields
list, which doesn't mandate a particular default but implies the common case
is "log the shift as worked."

**Clock in / clock out implemented (spec 13.4, 14.2, role matrix).** This was
schema-ready (`time_entries.clock_in_at`/`clock_out_at`, `missing_clock_out`
status chip, reminder type) but had no UI anywhere — the role matrix lists
clock in/out as the nanny's primary mechanism and `14.2` lists it as a primary
home-screen button, so this was a real gap, not a future phase. Added to
`src/routes/Time.tsx`, visible to nanny only (parents/co-admins use manual
entry per the role matrix). Clock-in inserts a `method: 'clock'` entry with
`status: 'draft'`; clock-out fills `clock_out_at`, computes `paid_hours` from
the elapsed time, accepts an optional note, and moves status to `submitted` —
mirroring how manual entries already move straight to `submitted`.

**Audit log viewer added (spec 13.7/14.7/19/20).** `audit_events` rows were
already being written from every sensitive action, but nothing read them back
— the spec requires Parent Admin (and optionally co-admin) be able to view
the audit log, and `19`/`20` describe it as a first-class requirement, not
optional polish. Added `src/routes/AuditLog.tsx`, linked from More, gated to
`isParentOrCoAdmin` in the UI; the existing RLS policy
(`can_manage_household_setting(household_id, 'view_audit_log')`) already
enforces the co-admin-can-be-restricted rule server-side, so the UI gate is a
convenience, not the security boundary.

**Missing-clock-out reminder no longer fires immediately on clock-in.**
`src/lib/reminders.ts` previously flagged `missing_clock_out` for *any* entry
with `clock_in_at` set and no `clock_out_at` — which, once clock-in/out
shipped, meant every nanny would see a "clock-out missing" warning the moment
they clocked in. Spec 21 says this should fire "after scheduled shift end
plus grace period." `computeReminders` doesn't currently receive schedule
data, so as a stand-in I used a flat 12-hour-since-clock-in threshold instead
of computing the actual scheduled end time. This is good enough to stop false
positives but isn't the schedule-aware version the spec describes — see
`QUESTIONS_AND_CLARIFICATIONS.md`.

## Earlier history (pre-existing, not made by this session)

Recovered from git log for context — not authored in this pass, listed so
the change log has continuity:

- Build Nanny Ledger Phase 1: schema, RLS, and parent-facing PWA
- Fix onboarding household-creation RLS bug and surface real error messages
- Navigate to dashboard after successful household creation
- Reject invalid calendar dates; add PTO/sick annual balance tracking; sort
  and link dashboard reminders
- Allow parents/co-admins to delete generated timesheets
- Soft-delete timesheets, dashboard-style Home, payment cadence settings
